Hey there!

Super excited to dive into my first landing page project with the Odin Project!

Before I decided to learn web development, I used to be a Thai teacher for foreigners, dreaming of my very own Thai language website!

So, 'itsttst' stands for 'It's time to speak Thai'â€”my not-so-genius attempt at naming things, but hey, we're here for the fun, right? Hahaha!

Wish me luck!! ðŸš€
